VERY VERY EARLY STOCK PICK GAME CODE

# Overall Concept
- Users will get a certain amount of starting money, and a set amount of stock picks.  The money will then be divided evenly between the picks
- Historical data for each ticker will be stored from close price daily
- Price should be saved to the second decimal
- By default, buys will happen at the end of each day (same as tracking)
- Date format: YYYY-MM-DD
- Track the users total gain (and percent)
- Track the users last 7 days of gain

# Additional ideas
- Draft style picks - users cannot pick the same stocks
- Rolling 12 month start to allow more people to join
- Multiple games (leagues) allowed
- If mid-game sells are allowed, use a ticker called "CASH" or something?
